Reflection
==========

This was my first attempt at serious form input. The project involved taking user input, validating it and then displaying validated content on the page. It also involved dynamically updating the user on the current status of some input fields.

Key learning:

Adding elements to the page dynamically
Form validation
Custom form validation error reporting


Next steps:

Make it prettier!
Add ARIA tags to form to improve accessibility
